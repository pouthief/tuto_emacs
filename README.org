#+title: Emacs Tutorial for the ARMEN students' seminar

Welcome to the bravest among you who have decided to join this
repository! Here I share with you the basic files and information you
need to get started using Emacs as your new text editor.

* Quick start
  
** Opening for the first time

   Emacs looks really ugly and scary when you open it for the first
   time... but don't be afraid! In this repository, I give you a basic
   configuration to load in order to start using Emacs with peace of
   mind. To do that, just navigate to the place you cloned this repo
   using ~C-x C-f~, and open the ~init.el~ file.

   Save this file to the directory Emacs looks for configuration by
   doing ~C-x C-w~ and entering ~/.emacs.d~.

   Then close Emacs using ~C-x C-c~. Re-open and observe the beauty of
   your new text editor. You may have to close and re-open Emacs
   various times in order to load the configuration properly.
