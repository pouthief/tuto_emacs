Welcome to the bravest among you who have decided to join this
repository! Here I share with you the basic files and information you
need to get started using Emacs as your new text editor.

* Installation

  Check the installation procedure corresponding to your operating
  system on the [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/][Emacs]] project website. [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/download.html#gnu-linux][GNU / Linux]] distributions are
  recommended, but Emacs can also be used with [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/download.html#macos][macOS]] or [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/download.html#windows][Windows]].

* Quick start
  
** Opening for the first time

   Emacs looks really ugly and scary when you open it for the first
   time... but don't be afraid! In this repository, I give you a basic
   configuration to load in order to start using Emacs with peace of
   mind. To do that:

   - Navigate to the place you cloned this repo using ~C-x C-f~, and open the ~init.el~ file
   - Save this file to the directory Emacs looks for configuration by doing ~C-x C-w~ and entering ~.emacs.d~
   - Close Emacs using ~C-x C-c~
   - Re-open and observe the beauty of your new text editor!

   You may have to close and re-open Emacs various times in order to
   load the configuration properly.
